# Frontend/UX Design Collaboration Project
## **Note:** This project is optional for Frontend Winter 2024 students

## Overview
For this project, you will be developing a web application based on a UX design from the UX Winter 2024 Cohort of your choice. This project aims to demonstrate your ability to convert a UX design into a functional web application using either Create React App or Next.js. Your project must adhere to the provided guidelines and include all necessary components and assets from the design.

### Requirements

#### 1. **Understanding the UX Design**
   - Choose a UX design for your project
   - Use the development view in Figma of the design to understand the layout, components, and styling
   - Goal: Convert the design into a web application using either Create React App or Next.js

#### 2. **CSS and Styling Guidelines**
   - Follow the CSS and other styling guidelines specified in the UX design
   - Use appropriate styling techniques to match the design as closely as possible

#### 3. **Routing and Pages**
   - Implement routing to create multiple pages within your application
   - Use React Router (for Create React App) or Next.js built-in routing to handle navigation between pages

#### 4. **State Management**
   - Use state to manage and process front-end updates of information
   - Implement state management techniques such as useState, useReducer, or context API to handle the application's state

#### 5. **Props and Context**
   - Pass data between components using props
   - Use context to manage global state and provide data to components that need it

#### 6. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure your application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
   - Follow the responsive design guidelines provided in your chosen UX design

#### 7. **Assets**
   - Include all assets (images, icons, fonts, etc.) provided in the UX design
   - Ensure that these assets are correctly referenced and displayed in your application

#### 8. **Accessibility**
   - Include basic accessibility considerations in your application
   - Ensure a proper hierarchy of text components (headings, paragraphs, etc.)
   - Use alt text for images to make your application accessible to screen readers

#### 9. **Server and Data Management**
   - Implement a server to manage the information needed for your application
   - Use a JSON file to store and manage the data
   - Set up API endpoints to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data where appropriate
   - Ensure that your front-end communicates with the server to fetch and update information

### Submission
Submit your project by providing a link to the GitHub repository containing your code. Ensure your repository includes the following:
   - A `README.md` file with an overview of your project, how to set it up, and instructions for running it
   - All necessary code files and assets
   - A deployed version of your application (optional but recommended)

### Getting Started
1. Choose your UX design and familiarize yourself with its components and layout
2. Set up your development environment using Create React App or Next.js
3. Start building your application, beginning with the main layout and routing
4. Implement state management, props, and context as needed
5. Set up a server and create a JSON file to manage your data
6. Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations and ensure your front-end communicates with the server
7. Apply CSS and other styling to match the design
8. Test your application for responsiveness and accessibility
9. Review and refine your code before submitting

Good luck with your project!
